# Directus Community Helm Charts

This is the Digitalist Helm chart for [Directus](https://directus.io/).

## Usage

To install the Directus Helm charts, you need to add the following repository:

```sh
helm repo add directus https://digitalist-se.github.io/directus-helm-chart
```

We are using repo name directus here, but if you would like to have both the
community chart and the digitalist chart, you could add it like this:
`helm repo add digi-directus https://digitalist-se.github.io/directus-helm-chart`


## Documentation

Chart documentation is found in [Directus directory](charts/directus/README.md).
